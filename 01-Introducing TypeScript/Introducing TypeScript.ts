// TypeScript 
// TypeScript is an open-source object-oriented language developed and maintained by Microsoft. 
// It is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
// TypeScript was first released in October 2012.
// It's the official language adopted by the Google Angular Team to write Angular projects.

// Typed superset of JavaScript programming 
    //- Adds the concept of static typing to the core futures of js
    //- Adds helpful and productive features without changing javaScript
    //- Built for large application, but great for applications of any size

// Dynamic Vs Static Languages
    // Dynamic                                       //Static
    // -- No Strict Types                            // -- Strict on Types
    // -- Forgiving                                  // -- Rigid
    // -- Great for web browser object model         // -- Promotes stability and maintainability

// Why TypeScript
    // JavaScript is a dynamic programming language with no type system.
    // A no type system means that a variable in JavaScript can have any type of value such as string, number, boolean etc.
    // The type system increases the code quality, readability and makes it an easy to maintain and refactor code base.
    // Errors can be caught at compile time (development) rather than at run time.

// Why Types?
    // One of the great things about type checking is that:
        // 1. It helps writing safe code because it can prevent bugs at compile time.
        // 2. Compilers can improve and run the code faster.
    // Itâ€™s worth noting that types are optional in TypeScript.

// TypeScript Transpilers - TypeScript Compiler
   // Tools that transfer code from one language to another!
    // TypeScript Also refers to the compiler which trans-compiles code written in TS syntax to JS
    // TypeScript compiles into simple JavaScript.
    // A TypeScript code is written in a file with .ts extension and then compiled into JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler.
    // A TypeScript compiler needs to be installed on your platform. 
    // Once installed, the command tsc filename.ts compiles the TypeScript code into a plain JavaScript file.
